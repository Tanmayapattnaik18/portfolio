                <p id="detailsParagraph" class="hidden">Greetings! I'm Tanmaya Pattnaik, a passionate individual with a keen interest in software development. Hailing from the vibrant city of Bhubaneswar, I completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from BPUT (Biju Patnaik University of Technology). My educational journey also led me to acquire specialized knowledge in mechatronics through a diploma from the Central Tool Room and Training Centre.

                    Driven by a curiosity for technology and innovation, I have ventured into the realm of software development. My academic background in mechanical engineering coupled with mechatronics training provides me with a unique perspective, allowing me to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.
                    
                    In my coding endeavors, I have honed my skills in HTML and JavaScript, utilizing them to create interactive and dynamic web applications. One of my notable achievements includes the implementation of click events in HTML and JavaScript code, demonstrating my ability to enhance user experiences through responsive and intuitive interfaces.
                    
                    I am excited about the endless possibilities that software development offers and am committed to continuous learning and growth in this dynamic field. Join me on this journey as I explore the boundless opportunities that the world of technology has to offer.
